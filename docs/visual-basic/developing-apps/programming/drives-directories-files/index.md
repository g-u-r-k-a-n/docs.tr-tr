# <a name="processing-drives-directories-and-files-visual-basic"></a>Sürücüleri, Dizinleri ve Dosyaları İşleme (Visual Basic)

You can use Visual Basic to process drives, folders, and files with the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object, which provides better performance and is easier to use than traditional methods such as the `FileOpen` and `Write` functions (although they are still available). The following sections discuss these methods in detail.
